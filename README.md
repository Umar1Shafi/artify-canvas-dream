Got it ✅ I carefully read your request and your project context (backend with FastAPI + frontend with npm dev server + AI models + tests). You want a **very simple, beginner-friendly README** that guides non-technical people through:

1. Environment setup
2. Pre-installing models (so runtime isn’t interrupted)
3. Running backend + frontend
4. Running tests (with your provided test drop-in)
5. A **developer quick commands section** at the end

Here’s a polished **README.md** draft you can directly drop into your repo:

---

# 🎨 Project Name

Welcome! This project lets you run an AI-powered app with both a backend (server) and a frontend (website).
No deep technical knowledge needed — just follow the steps **in order**.

---

## 🚀 1. Setup the Environment

You only need to do this once.

### What you need

* **Python 3.10+**
* **Node.js 18+**
* Internet connection (to fetch dependencies & models)

### Step A — Clone or unzip the project

Put the project folder somewhere easy, e.g. `Desktop/project`.

### Step B — Create a Python environment

**Windows (PowerShell):**

```powershell
python -m venv .venv
.\.venv\Scripts\Activate
```

**macOS / Linux:**

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
```

### Step C — Install Python dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Step D — Install Node.js dependencies (frontend)

```bash
npm install
```

---

## 📥 2. Pre-Download AI Models (important!)

To avoid delays when first running, **download the models now**.

```bash
python scripts/download_models.py
```

*(This script will fetch all required AI weights into the `models/` folder. Only needed once.)*

---

## ▶️ 3. How to Run the App

You need **two terminals** (keep both open).

### Terminal 1 — Start the backend

```bash
uvicorn backend.server:app --host 127.0.0.1 --port 8000 --reload
```

You should see:
`INFO: Uvicorn running on http://127.0.0.1:8000`

### Terminal 2 — Start the frontend

```bash
npm run dev
```

You should see:
`Local:   http://localhost:5173`

👉 Open that link in your browser. Done!

---

## ✅ 4. How to Run the Tests

This project ships with two kinds of tests:

1. **Backend tests (fast)** — check the server.
2. **Frontend E2E tests (optional)** — open the website in a real browser and click through actions.

### 0) What you need once

* Python 3.10+
* Node.js 18+ (only if you want browser tests)
* About 1–2 minutes

*(Windows tip: open PowerShell, copy-paste the commands)*

---

### 1) Run backend tests (recommended)

```bash
# activate environment first (see above)
pip install -r tests/backend/requirements.txt
pytest -q tests/backend
```

**What success looks like:**

```
3 passed, 2 skipped in 0.05s
```

---

### 2) Run frontend tests (optional)

Keep the frontend running (`npm run dev`), then:

```bash
cd tests/e2e
npm i
npm run e2e:install   # one-time browser download
npm run e2e           # headless run
npm run e2e:headed    # visible browser run
```

**Success looks like:**

```
2 passed
```

*(If short on space, see Playwright cache note in `tests/README`.)*

---

### 3) What the tests actually check

* **Backend:** server health, bad inputs rejected, large images handled, tiny smoke pipeline (optional).
* **Frontend:** homepage loads, upload works, errors shown correctly.

---

## 🛠 5. Developer Quick Commands

All important commands in one place:

```bash
# Setup
python -m venv .venv && .\.venv\Scripts\Activate   # (Windows)
pip install -r requirements.txt
npm install
python scripts/download_models.py

# Run backend
uvicorn backend.server:app --host 127.0.0.1 --port 8000 --reload

# Run frontend
npm run dev

# Run backend tests
pytest -q tests/backend

# Run frontend tests
cd tests/e2e && npm i && npm run e2e
```

---

## 🎯 That’s it!

* First run: setup → download models → start backend + frontend.
* Later runs: just activate the venv and start backend + frontend.
* Tests are optional but show everything works.
